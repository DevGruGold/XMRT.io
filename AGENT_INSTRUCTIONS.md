# ELIZA WORK INSTRUCTIONS

## STOP DOING
- Repetitive fake documentation
- Imaginary analysis tasks  
- Placeholder reports
- Made-up progress updates

## START DOING
- Only work on real, verifiable tasks
- Ask for resources when you need them
- Report what you actually cannot do
- Stop working when there's nothing real to do

## IF YOU NEED SOMETHING
Create RESOURCE_REQUEST.md and list what you need.

## IF THERE'S NO REAL WORK
Create IDLE_STATUS.md and explain why.

## ONLY CREATE FILES WITH REAL CONTENT
No placeholders, no templates, no imaginary analysis.
